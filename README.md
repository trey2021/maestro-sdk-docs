## Setup
### Physical setup for use before wearing Maestro Alpha

- Plug USB extension adapter into HTC Vive USB 3.0 port located next to the ports for the standard Vive cords.
  - To access the above USB 3.0 port, slide the plate where the cords enter the headset forward.
- Plug male USB connector side of the male USB/ Male USB micro cord into the USB extension adapter.
- Make sure the HTC Tracker is attached in place on top of the forearm unit.
  - Proper placement should have the charging port for the Tracker facing backwards toward your elbow. 

### Putting on Maestro Alpha

1. Plug Male USB micro connector into the back of Maestroâ€™s forearm housing.
2. Attach battery supply holster to your waist, with the power cord attached to the batteries in the holster.
3. Slide hand through forearm straps, without putting the glove on your hand yet. Make sure the forearm housing is sitting flat on the top side of your forearm. 
4. Plug the power cord into the back of Maestro.
5. Put on the glove by opening from the palm side leather and sliding your closed fist inside, then give each finger cap a very slight tug to allow enough flexibility while fitting each finger into the appropriate finger sleeve until your fingertips are snugly inside their respective finger cap. 
6. Tighten the 1 front strap followed by the 2 back straps on the forearm housing until the unit is comfortably firm and snug against your arm. 

### Taking off Maestro Alpha 
1. Loosen the three forearm straps. 
2. Gently tug on each finger cap to allow your finger to exit the cap. 
3. Pull from the palm side leather to remove your palm.
4. Remove your thumb from inside; if needed, hold on to the finger cap to allow for a less resistant removal. 
5. Once your thumb and palm are outside of the gloves fabric portion, slightly pull on the four remaining finger caps while sliding each finger out. 
6. With your hand fully removed from the fabric portion of the glove you can unplug both the power and USB cords from the back of the Maestro, if needed. 
7. Hold on to the top of the housing as you pull your arm and hand out of the forearm straps.

[For calibration step visuals, see here](https://contact-control-interfaces.github.io/maestro-sdk-docs/C/html/index.html#calibrationHeader).

- Wrist:
  - Moving your wrist through its full range of motion 3 times helps capture the most accurate calibration.
- Fingers:
  - A single movement of closing the fingers from fingers flat, followed by reopening, helps capture the most accurate calibration the 4 fingers.
  - Do not hyperextend your finger when opening fingers from the closed position.
  - Keeping wrist still is crucial for gathering accurate calibration data.
- Thumb:
  - Circling in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions 2 or 3 times helps capture the most accurate calibration for thumb.
